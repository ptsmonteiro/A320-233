v1.2    Mar 30, 2010

Hello. This is another incremental update of the A320-233.
This update fixes a couple of nagging annoyances, specifically:
* Passenger compartment windows are always transparent, even at night
* Pilots are removable (default to 'Out of the Cockpit')

If you want the pilots in their seats, set up a button to toggle (or set) the
tailhook (in Settings/Joystick & Equipment/Buttons: Adv). My expectation is that
operating this control will not noticably affect the operation of the A320, which, 
in fact, is not actually fitted with a tailhook...

This release is otherwise identical to v1.1a and will function under versions of 
X-Plane as old as v9.31

v1.1a   Oct 15, 2009

Hello. I erroneously built the 1.1 release with X-Plane PlaneMaker v9.40RC12.
Consequently, those folk who were running the release version of X-Plane (v9.31)
were not able to use this plane, once downloaded.

This release is *identical* to v1.1 except that it was produced with X-Plane
PlaneMaker v9.31

Sorry for the foul-up. It won't happen again.

I'm including the JetBlue livery, by Noah Lieberman, in case you haven't 
downloaded it already...

v1.1    Oct 9, 2009

Hello, and thank you for downloading this update release of the A320-233.


This release fixes a few bugs, fixes the engine nacelles, and introduces a brand
new Mexicana livery. This release is the result of literally hundreds of hours of
flight testing in order to refine the performance characteristics.

As before, this is a drop-in replacement for Christian Piviere's A320, including
all of his liveries. I have done a *very* *little* repair work on his liveries,
in particular fixing the night-time cockpit windows (they were opaque [!?!?]).

I am including two icon files, one featuring TACA livery, and the other
featuring Mexicana livery. If you want one or the other, simply copy it to
A320_icon.png

I am eager to start an group to work on further refinements and developing new
stuff (such as new liveries). Beginning with this release I am starting a new
website where that stuff will become available before it's posted anywhere
else. 

The URL for the new site is: http://www.gkpnet.net/x-plane

As of today (Oct 9 2009, 17:00PDT) there's not much there - not even all of my
present stuff is there yet - but I've built a skeleton and I'll be adding more
as it becomes available. In particular, keep your eyes peeled for an improved 
Avianca!

Enjoy the new and improved A320-233

I did!

P.S.
Feel free to drop me a note if you want to; I'm open to feedback, job offers,
etc.

I am particularly interested in hearing from folk who want to put some quality
time in to do some quality work.
